You should do most of the exercises because they're basic checks that you've understood the material. If you can't solve an exercise relatively easily, you've probably missed something fundamental.

The problems are more difficult than the exercises, and you'll likely struggle to solve some problems.

I don't recommend working through all the problems. What's even better is to find your own project.
